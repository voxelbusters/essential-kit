# Use Cases

### Sell Virtual Goods

Use in-app purchases (Consumable/Non-Consumable) to sell in-game items or levels of your game which gives them an added advantage. This can be achieved indirectly too by allowing them to buy virtual coins and exchange them for in-game items.

### Option for Removing Ads

Use in-app purchases (Non-Consumable) to let user pay for ad-free experience.
