# FAQ

## Why my universal links information on server is not updating on mobile?

Once your app is installed, the universal links meta data from your website will be cached with in your app. So until you reinstall, what ever changes you make to AASA or applinks files on your server won't have any effect.

## How to validate universal links configuration?

There is a [**validator**](https://branch.io/resources/aasa-validator/) on branch.io which you can use for validation.
