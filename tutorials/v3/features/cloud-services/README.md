### Use-cases

### Store your player progress

As the profile data size will be [in the limits](faq.md#how-much-data-i-can-store) , you can save to cloud so that your user's won't miss their progress.

### Replacement to [Player Prefs](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefs.html)

As Player preferences is local to the device, you can replace it with Cloud Services to store the details specific to the user across devices.
