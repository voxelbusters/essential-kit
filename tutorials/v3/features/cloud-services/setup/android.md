# Android

On Android, Plugin uses **Saved Games feature** of Play Games Services. Internally, Cloud services depend on Google play login for user authentication. For this reason it needs Play Services Application Id.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are NOT planning to use Game Services along with Cloud Services, you still need to fill the **Play Services Application Id** entry in Game Services settings (and can  disable it).\
\
Check [here](../../game-services/setup/#properties) (Android Properties tab) on how to get Play Services Application Id.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
As cloud services on Android uses google play services(Game Services) internally, you need to make sure the required authentication is handled. You can check [here](https://assetstore.essentialkit.voxelbusters.com/game-services/setup/android#configuring-credentials-sha-fingerprint-authentication) on how to add required credentials for Cloud Services to authenticate successfully.
